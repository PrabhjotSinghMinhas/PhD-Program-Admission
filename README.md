# PhD-program-admission
Purpose:
This project aimed to look at raw data of admission rates for six different departments for Ph.D. programs from a highly regarded University to examine gender equality and to see if there were any takeaways to be made.

Results:
To set up the data for analysis, I first converted the aggregated data into original level data, and ran a cross-tabulation of Genderâ€™s impact on outcome Admission, controlling for Layer Variable Department.
In the Chi-Square Test, when controlling for Department, Gender has a statistically significant impact on Admission for Department 1, but not for Department 2 through 6. Since this was just the Chi-Square Test, which identifies there is a significant relationship between one of the dependent variables on the outcome variable, but it does not inform of the nature of the relationship, so I then went on to look at the Risk Estimates.

The Risk Estimate showed the Odds Ratio for Gender (F:M), and Success of outcome variable was Admission: No, or Rejection. Department 2-6 have risk estimates with confidence intervals that include 1, this is saying that the odds of a female getting rejected is essentially the same as the odds of a male getting rejected for these departments. For Department 1, the Odds ratio is 0.349, which means females are only 0.35 times as likely to be rejected as male for this department. Or, the inverse is that males are 3 times as likely to be rejected as females for this department. From this, we can conclude that the impact of gender on the admission outcome is dependent on the variable Department.

  The likelihood of being accepted to the PhD program would be dependent on which department one was trying to get into. A female would have a statistically significant chance of being accepted into Department 1 than a male. And based on male acceptance alone, males are less likely to get accepted in Department two compared to the other five departments.
